Explanation (reference picture attached):
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

int x;
x = 5 > 8 ? 10 :
1 != 2 < 5 ? 20 :
30;
printf("Value of X: %d", x);
return 0;
}
********
Value of x = 30, as these are ternary operators the value before the "?" is checked first, hence:
5 > 8 ? is false meaning that it will move past 10, and the other side of the ':' to the "else" condition which is:
1 != 2 < 5 ? because of the orderof precedence in operators it is evaluated as:
1. 2 < 5 gives 1
2. as 1 != 1 gives 0
because the condition of "1 != 1" is not true it will  move past 20, and the other side of the ':' to the "else" condition which is:
30 = x
